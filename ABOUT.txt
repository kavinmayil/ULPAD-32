Introduction :
The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has created demand for microcontroller platforms that are flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient. Conventional development boards often integrate a fixed set of peripherals, which limits expandability and results in higher power consumption when unused peripherals remain active. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ultra-low power attach-and-detach MCU platform that allows users to interconnect multiple ESP32-S3–based modules through a standardized connector interface. Each module can act as either a core controller or an expansion board, enabling modular system design with minimal power overhead.
The platform introduces a border connector with unified communication pins (UART, I²C, SPI, power rails, and reset lines), allowing multiple ESP32-S3 modules to function together. This approach effectively expands GPIO availability, distributes subsystem workloads (e.g., storage, audio, power management), and optimizes energy usage by isolating inactive modules. The attach/detach method also supports application-specific customization, making the system adaptable for IoT, robotics, and embedded research.
